                <h2>Bacon Q Dog</h2>
                <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three
                    different
                    beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as
                    long as
                    he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not
                    wanting to
                    admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p>
                <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his
                    energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his
                    toys "a
                    ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

                <p>Loves chasings tennis balls, chipmunks, squirrels, and birds. Often found sitting by the fire in
                    wintertime,
                    and in sun patches when available. He’s energetic, mischievous, and easily bored.
                    He loves people and gets grumpy if left without a lap too long. </p>
                <P>Loves barking up trees, running around on the lawn, and digging in the dirt looking for moles.
                    He especially likes getting treats and whines when he comes inside and doesn’t get a snack. </P>

                <h2>Rocket</h2>
                <p>Rocket (also named huihui) is a 6-month pomeranian puppy with big eyes and a small, black cute nose.
                    Rocket is named rocket because he runs so fast and energetic all day without even having some rest.
                    Rocket loves to carry his little toy walking around the house and jumping towards my bed. </p>
                <P>Rocket is friendly to all human beings. He will be a little shy at first, but will ‘say hi’ to you
                    after
                    a few seconds. He is also friendly to dogs, especially the small breed, because the large size dogs
                    are
                    hard for him to smell lol.
                    If you meet rocket, don’t hesitate to say hi to him!! He will be super happy the whole day.</P>

                <h2>Juno</h2>
                <p>No one knows exactly what breed Juno is, but that makes him all the more special. He was adopted
                    before
                    he was one year old; despite this and his German shepherd-esque looks, he stayed close to the same
                    size,
                    hovering around 50 lbs into adulthood. At the weathered age of ten years old, Juno is dealing with
                    hip
                    problems, but manages to stay in good spirits </p>
                <P>One of Juno’s favorite pastimes is finding the dirtiest puddle within a one-mile radius and making
                    sure
                    every inch of him makes contact with said puddle. If rolling around in dirt was an Olympic sport,
                    Juno
                    would have been the one that facilitated its inclusion into the Olympics.</P>
